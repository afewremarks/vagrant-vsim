vagrant-vsim
============
**Credits**: This project makes use of the excellent instructions on how to simulate Data ONTAP 8.1.1. with Virtualbox by BOBSHOUSEOFCARDS: http://community.netapp.com/t5/Simulator-Discussions/Simulate-ONTAP-8-1-1-withVirtualBox/m-p/2227#M89

**Caution**: This project is in pre alpa state. This project uses Virtualbox which is a non supported configuration. There are smaller "hacks" for making this work and it is not pretty. Use at own risk. Please see known issues at the bottom.

**Goal**: The goal of this project is to create a largely automated setup of a Clustered Data Ontap simulator using vagrant in order to ease demos, speed up testing and help become more familiar with cDOT and its integration in projects like OpenStack.


System requirements
============
 - 8 GB Ram
 - 20 GB of free disk space
 - SSD 
 - Linux / Mac
 - Internet connection on first run

Install
============
 - Install Virtualbox if not already installed: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
 - Install Vagrant if not already installed: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
 - Clone this repo
 - Download the Clustered Data Ontap 8.2.2P1 Simulator for VMware Workstation, VMware Player, and VMware Fusion from http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/tools/simulator/ontap/8.X/
 - Save the downloaded file 'vsim_netapp-cm.tgz' to this project's root directory, e.g. ~/vagrant-vsim/vsim_netapp-cm.tgz
 - You need to add the Cluster base license. **Important**: Use the **non-ESX build** license. Edit vsim.conf, at the top set the 8.2.2P1 Cluster base license within CLUSTER_BASE_LICENSE accordingly. The license can be obtained from http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/tools/simulator/ontap/8.X/.
 - Optionally, edit vsim.conf and define any additional licenses as a comma separated list within LICENSES accordingly. **Important**: Use the **non-ESX build licenses**. The additional licenses can be obtained from http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/tools/simulator/ontap/8.X/
 - Double check you have added the **non-ESX build** licenses.
 - Run 'vagrant up' from this directory, e.g. ~/vagrant-vsim/
 - You will be asked to import the Simulator as a Vagrant box. Press "y" to proceed and import. The import will take a few minutes
 - Wait until the VSim is ready. Once ready, you can use 'vagrant ssh vsim' to access the VSim console
 - When done, you can destroy the environment using 'vagrant destroy' and recreate with 'vagrant up'


Uninstall
============
 - Run 'vagrant destroy' from this directory, e.g. ~/vagrant-vsim/. 
 - Run 'vagrant box remove vsim'
 - Run 'vagrant box remove trusty'
 - If desired, uninstall Virtualbox and vagrant

Known issues
============
 - There is no error handling in place, please do not just abort the program when things take a while. At first start, please be patient, preparing the VSim vagrant box can take several minutes.
 - Windows is currently not working but may be possible in the future
 - Occassionaly, vagrant destroy will error can not delete all VM disks. Manual deletion is required.
 - The setup is limited to a single node cluster
